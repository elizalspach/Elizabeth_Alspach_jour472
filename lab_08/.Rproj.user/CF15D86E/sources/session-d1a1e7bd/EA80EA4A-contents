## About this lab

To complete this lab, you need to:
* write code in empty codeblocks provided to answer questions included (look for **Q**).
* write out the answer in the form of a complete sentence in the space given (look for **A**).

When you are finished, commit changes and push to your personal GitHub repo, then submit the URL to this document on ELMS.

## Load libraries and establish settings
**Task**: Load janitor and the tidyverse

```{r}
library(janitor)
library(tidyverse)
```


## Load data

**Task**: Load four tables of U.S. Census data.  Each table has one row per Maryland county with 2020 population information.  Each table has these same two columns:

* geoid - a unique identifier for each county
* name - the county name

The third column in each table represents the total population in one of four demographic categories.

* maryland_population.csv - total_pop - total population 
* maryland_hispanic.csv - hispanic_pop - total Hispanic population
* maryland_white.csv - white_pop - total White alone population
* maryland_black.csv - black_pop - total Black alone population

```{r}
maryland_black <- read_csv("data/maryland_black.csv") %>% 
  clean_names()

maryland_white <- read_csv("data/maryland_white.csv") %>% 
  clean_names()

maryland_hispanic <- read_csv("data/maryland_hispanic.csv") %>% 
  clean_names()


maryland_pop <- read_csv("data/maryland_population.csv") %>% 
  clean_names()
```

Some of the information in the tables may need to be cleaned or validated in order to produce the correct answer.  

## Questions

**Q1**  What Maryland county has the largest Hispanic population (by percentage of total population)?
**A1** *Montgomery County, Maryland has the largest Hispanic population.*
```{r}
#join maryland population and maryland hispanic table by geoid
#could also change the montgomery county name to be cleaned, so there is a space in between "Montgomery County" and "Maryland" in the value. Joining by geoid got same result.
updated_hispanic <- maryland_hispanic %>% 
  inner_join(maryland_pop, by="geoid")

#find the largest ones
largest_md_hispanic <- updated_hispanic %>% 
  select(geoid, name.x, hispanic_pop, total_pop) %>% 
  mutate(pct_hispanic =(hispanic_pop)/(total_pop)*100) %>% 
  arrange(desc(pct_hispanic))

view(largest_md_hispanic)
```


**Q2**  What is the total population of people who identify as white alone in Maryland? 
**A2**  *There are 3,275,048 people that identify as white in Maryland.*
```{r}
#divided by 100 to get the proper value, since it was unclean to be multiplied by 100
white_md_clean <- maryland_white %>% 
  mutate(clean_white_pop = case_when(name == "Somerset County, Maryland" & geoid == 24039 ~ 13510,
            TRUE ~ white_pop))

sum(white_md_clean$clean_white_pop)
  
```


**Q3** What is the average Black population in all Maryland counties? 
**A3** *There is an average 109,386.3 Black population in all Maryland counties.*
```{r}
black_md_clean <- maryland_black %>% 
  mutate(clean_black_pop = case_when(name == "Baltimore city, Maryland" & geoid == 24510 ~ 585708,
                                     name == "Baltimore County, Maryland" & geoid == 24005 ~ 854535,
                                     TRUE ~ black_pop))

mean(black_md_clean$clean_black_pop)
```
