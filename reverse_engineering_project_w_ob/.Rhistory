percent(total_rows_black_women / total_rows_female)
#Black women account for 19.35% of the women shot, or close to 20 percent - this figure is slightly off likely due to updates in the dataframe in the four years since the article was published. We're unsure as to why the number is lower, but it's unclear if the number changed since the investigation was published.
#filter for unarmed females
female_unarmed <- filtered_shootings %>%
filter(armed_with == "unarmed", gender == "female")
#Find number of rows excluding those with "N/A" for race (black_women_unarmed doesn't have any "N/A" values for race, but adding based on mindset that wapo reporters are working with regularly updated data)
total_rows_black_women_unarmed <- sum(!is.na(black_women_unarmed$race))
total_rows_female_unarmed <- sum(!is.na(female_unarmed$race))
#find percent change
percent(total_rows_black_women_unarmed / total_rows_female_unarmed)
#Black women accounted for 26.92% of unarmed deaths. This isn't the exact 28% figure, but we're unsure if this is a result of our syntax or just a database update since the time of publication.
